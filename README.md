AICI – AI Compute & Infrastructure ETF

Overview

AICI is a rules-based ETF concept designed to capture the infrastructure layer that enables artificial intelligence at scale. Rather than focusing on AI software or platform companies, the fund targets the physical backbone of AI, including semiconductors, foundries, data centers, networking hardware, and power and cooling infrastructure.

This project was built independently to explore how real ETF and index products are designed, from idea generation to portfolio construction and risk control.

Investment Rationale

Many AI-focused ETFs are heavily tilted toward large-cap software and platform companies, often diluting exposure to the companies that actually build and operate AI infrastructure.

AICI was designed to address this gap by focusing on:
- GPU and accelerator manufacturers
- Semiconductor foundries and equipment providers
- Memory and interconnect suppliers
- Data center and server operators
- Networking hardware companies
- Power delivery and thermal management infrastructure

The goal is to provide targeted exposure to AI infrastructure while maintaining diversification and investability.

Methodology Summary

The ETF was constructed using a systematic, rules-based process:
1. Built a global universe of 140+ AI-exposed companies
2. Applied eligibility screens for market capitalization, liquidity, geographic exposure, and theme relevance
3. Narrowed the universe to 53 qualifying stocks
4. Developed a composite scoring framework to rank companies objectively
5. Selected a diversified 30-stock portfolio based on scores
6. Applied single-stock and subsector caps to control concentration risk
7. Designed a periodic rebalancing framework

The full methodology and assumptions are documented in the research report.

Portfolio Construction
- Number of holdings: 30
- Weighting approach: Score-weighted with diversification constraints
- Rebalance frequency: Annual (conceptual)
- Focus: AI infrastructure purity, liquidity, and diversification

A snapshot of top holdings and subsector exposure can be found in the charts folder and research report.
